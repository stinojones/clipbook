## **Overview**
### **What is this project?**  
This iOS app lets you capture multiple moments throughout the day, seamlessly merging them into a 10-second video journal entry. It encourages users to document their lives meaningfully without getting lost in filming everything. It addresses the tendency to record entire events, like a Disneyland ride, instead of fully living in the moment. I built this app because I love journaling and capturing daily moments. I wanted to create something that combines these passions while promoting a balanced, present-focused approach to documenting life.
