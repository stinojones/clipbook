## **Overview**  

### **What is Clipbook?**  
Clipbook is a lightweight iOS app designed to distill your day into a 10-second video journal. It offers features such as pause/resume recording and clip merging, empowering users to document their lives meaningfully without the overwhelm of over-recording.

This app encourages mindfulness by helping users focus on living in the moment while capturing highlights. The project reflects a passion for journaling and thoughtful storytelling.

### **Why Clipbook?**  
Many users film entire events, such as vacations or theme park rides, which can lead to missing out on the essence of the experience. Clipbook solves this by limiting recordings to short, impactful clips, perfect for journaling and reflecting on meaningful memories.
